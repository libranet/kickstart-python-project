# To avoid duplication, we try to configure the tools in pyproject.toml as much as possible.
# we call the executables via "poetry run <executable>"
#
# Usage:
#   > pre-commit install
#   > pre-commit install hooks  -f
#   > pre-commit autoupdate
#   > pre-commit run --all-files

# default_install_hook_types: [commit-msg, pre-commit]

# configuration-wide default for the stages property of hooks.
# This will only override individual hooks that do not set stages.
# default_stages: [commit, manual, pre-commit, pre-push]  # default: (all stages)

default_language_version:
  python: python3.11

# to have pre-commit stop running hooks after the first failure
