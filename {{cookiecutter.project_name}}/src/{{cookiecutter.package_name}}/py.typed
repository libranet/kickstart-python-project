# py.typed is a marker file for PEP 561:
# "Package maintainers who wish to support type checking of their code
# MUST add a marker file named py.typed to their package supporting typing.
# This marker applies recursively: if a top-level package includes it,
# all its sub-packages MUST support type checking as well."
# see https://peps.python.org/pep-0561.
